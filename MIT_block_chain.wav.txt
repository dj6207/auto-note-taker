ecause were ant have a good time ismtermy name is garry ganceler i'm a senior lecturer here at mitslone i'm also an advisor over the emmi-t media labnd i've spent a lifetime around world of finance and money in public policy and i've bin an mit this last eight months and we're gonto learn a lot together about block chain and moneywere gn have a little bit of fun here and see what we o do so we're talking about block chain and money that's where we are by the way i do cold callido call on uif you wantto leave now i understandbecause i want to have an interaction
little bit about it so my first question for class for everyone whether registered or not how many of you haveever owned ecrypto currencyduch seems about forty-five percent of ouu wanttokeep your hand up longhow any of you have ever worked on any block-chain related projects and an entrprenurial setting or corporate setting anywheret inthe roomsoyoualt know probably more than i do
but im nto give it a shotimoin't always start every week with what are te study questions for the weekmy ofyou actually got the syllabusis notinga greated assignment i just havet havea sense whowoactually got the syllabuyouactually did the two readings it's not created i just got engaged heclassohthankyouourthose greatsthe two main questions for thi week's lecture reallywhatis blockchain andwhy might it be a catalyst and i emphasize the word mightn't be a catalyst for changeinthe world of finance we could talk about a lot about things outside the world of finance and blockchain may indeed have a lot
of applications outside o finance but i've chosen to just narrow the scope a bit so semesters really about blockchain and mone yor blockchan an financeand secondly you will see index cards on everyone of these roundtablesone assignment by the end of the class you could do it now or later i would like each of you anonymously right on card what you wanto achieve in this semesteritcould b nyfrom class from learning about blockchan from making money on bidcoin i don't care if you tell me t meeting your future spass jst ke what do you want to achieve in this clss i can't help you on third
but i'll try to help yuthe things i can help you and saprina and toledo will collect thim later and next tusday we'll tellu the results what is it that you want to achieve in this class and then we'll see at the end of the semester if we've done thatsjust a way to help guide me help youso s that's what we're trying to doso what were the two readings one was a little hing i did ink i did with some of my colleagues and om since i know would you take out of readings
did yu have a good summerdid you raise your handwhoinclass read the readings and took something different han omhsaid the was ponialyour first ametechnicalsie technical cycoliehemony agreed with elon two or three haven agreed with tomcoreand how many of you're too shy on the first day to put your hands oup
so i went to start  go back the internet hooi sort of i've come about this andsero thought about hwhat s blockchain what is it really about while the internet started many decades ago before most of youwere born butnineteen-seventy-formpredecessors even from late sixties the ethernet whichreally how two computers communicate and then you had tcpip which really the internet protocol of multiplecomputerscomtalking to each otherlater on in nineteen-ninety-hatto we move forward does anybody no htpwhere they might be
first name would be helpweb cottransportwhos associated with the inventionanybody elseanybody it's not releanybody know who's associate with tcppcompanyedbi don't know if it was a company sociatewith the myt
had some association withso these were first three letters and then there were companies commercializaon three com in cisco and of course amazon that's still around todaybut there was something else going on how do we commercialize the internet does anybody know what this scen is fromgood thought good thought first pete assolt by bidqy but noereain't movie hackerstheyhav yever seen the movie it's not a good movie
this is the opening scene of the net yes that sander bullockin the years nineteen-ninety-five it's a cyberthrillera presidenc involved the defense departments involved and so forthbut actually pitzahot is associated with the very first sale on-linesaleanywhere in the worldthey started something called piza-nitscreen by the wayif you wanted to go on you could order your pitza butthere was one problem does anybody know what the problem pizantmay be the rmultiple problemso
you couldn't pay onlinenobody figured out how to move money onlineyou hadto pay when you showd up with pizaso now i wento talk a little bit about cryptography were goud to spend a lot of time on cryptography it's scryptocurrent season what's cryptographyyouyou got start thereanyody wantto help j outis anybody wanto help tell me you iwere goto figure out how to have everybody have nameplaces by next week but will work with ry
o itthat wbeencriptiit's how do you encrypt something so it's not detectable by othersor an essence its communications in the presence of adversariesyou have an adversary ance communiaion you want to commun and not let your adversarie know that communitrue for ancient timesso in ancient times there was something called cipher and thi was the way that you take a piece of leather or pethcl
en have a lot of letters and both sides  encrypt and decrypt because there were different measurements of the cylinderbody seen move imitation gamesthe enigma machinethe movie was wonderful cause it said touring cracked it andh did help crack it in an automated way but actually the polish government had craced in the nineteenh-thirtiesbefore they fell to germans but anntouring built on all of that and incracked it furtherandthe in the nineteen-seventies  was here mit to some extenttheres priv
ikpubliccryptography which i'm not gong a dive into today but it's the heart of bitcoin and block chain it's the heart of the internet but it's about the keything is communications in the presence of adversariesaty keep a secret when everbody wants in and get that informationand there's a long history an mitees at the centr of lot o a lot of early cryptography failed on the internet and the early nineties and late eighties david cham and others tryed to do things and were not gonto debate these today you'll have one reading i think it's ether next week which will give you that history
it's worthwhile knowing about the history of failurebut cryptography is the reason why the internet works today does anybody wantto tell me what ssaycomputer scientistrmind your first uplic afactprovie increption using  symmetric cace which is publicraphso it basically uses a symmetric cryptography which weregotto talk about two lectures from now but it secures the whole internet
sudn you could deliver the pizza and get a piascode and i have totell you i never knew how this worked before i was a ipapel came along in nineteen-ninety-eighti mention a whole bunch of other digital currencies then failedbutsome of these people who will read later ie will read ncebo's piece on smart contracts later adam back who created hashcash some of these innovations were what setochi nacomoto later usedsome innovations which were really helpful and worked were alipe an mpesaanybody
le moble sillular in essence they found out in kenya thi was twelve years ago the people were trading mobile minutesthey were unbanked but they had celular phones and they were trading their minutes as a form of currencyand seporicom realized that in sad way we could help people be part of digital economy even if they're unbankedand i africa-to-day a half of the adult populaccording to worldback figures is still unbankedbut half of that half mobil
empess twenty-million customers in soform of money that's kind of swapping mobile minutesbut the riddle remained how to you move money on the internet where in essence how to you move value peerd appear without a centralized intermediary and that's the core of blockchain technologyso who solved the riddletell mewho the rilewho solved thi riddlewearing a tshirt that says quentontrioso kquenterantino should solve a ridle
wicherand who sawed thi lso appear to peer ch this is the actual docktop of an email that was sent out on hallowing two thousand and eight by catochinacomoowe don't actually know who setochinacomoto is but it's a study questionin a few lectures from to ask you to tell mewhoouthink setohicomoto is so i won't ask that nowand he started with a very simple sentence in his email i've been working on a new electronic system that fully ppear appear with no trusted third party
it's kind of a modest statementsothe question is  another internet layerwere gonto explore thatthis whole semestert really have answer i don't think e best minds itytcould really yet tell youtherere some who are maximalis and say yesit will be therand in this course rewere gonto view the minimalist ene maximali werei going to try to center ite in one place but that's the kkin questionso whs a block chain we're do this in a lot of lectures notry do it short version
so its time-stamped apenned logs meaning you can add a little bit of information to this and its timestampedthese release blocks being addedstoshi did not invent blockchaiearlieybody anto guess wayou  have a reading about this btearly nineteen-ninetyeshastuart stuart worked for bell laps rightso one of your assignments it's not gong to be a grated asinwitch this can be a fun assignment
could any of you i gon tosay by next thursday just have some fun find the longest timewise longest running block chainit's not goingand it's been running since mid-nineties and your clue is the new york timeswill discuss it next thursdaybut timestamped block-lockblock block of data creates a database and auditable database and wi'll talk about ledgers particularly next week but will talk about ledgers all throughout this course and how it changes the world o finance now it's secured by
ptography because cryptography remembers communications and magasure adversaries can pick you off were cant learn about hash functions and hsh functions are really important part of cryptography and initially for databasisanhad a search and store information and databasis but in this circumstance hash functions were the way to not only apend the next block to the prior blocks but really importantly o compressed data to make it more manipulable and verifyitive written here tamper resistance and the integritydigital signatures which has to do the publicky private
cryptgraphythere pre-request to this course you do tve had to have taken computer science cryptography algorithms if i could learn a little bit about hash functions and asymmetric cryptographythese are two key important we have enough computer scientists in this room that can sort us out if i say the wrong thingnconsensus so there's a really important part of th block chain is how do you decide who apmpends that next block cause when i went back here ite's block block each of these blocks somebody has to decide who appends
who gets to pick the next block and that's what's called consensus protocol and there's wide debates about consensus protocoland will talk alot about consensus protcol but in essence it addresses somei a term called the cost to troston will talk about byzantine general's problems which is another reading the byzantine general's problem was laid out as a sort of mathematical game theory issue some thirt years agothat's what sotochinacmotosoft wa thi last byzantine general piza for bid coinsa year and a half after sotochi-nacomoto
laidout block chainbsomebody sentn email and you'll get these slides but this is the real-live email i'll pay a ten thousand bidcoins for a couple of pizzasjst guy who sent h says i like unions pepper sausage mushroomslasloh date this is may eighteenth and he's offering ten thousand bitcoinsof two thousand and tnbut the key line is what i'm aiming for is getting food deliver an exchange for bidcoins nobody had used bitcoins as a medium of exchangesixteen months into is istence nobody had used it to buy some
and laslow is a computer scientist in florida was just kind of interested and he put this out onemaillistthree days later he stolled usn't have his two pieces so nobody wants to buy me a pezze's the big coin amount i'm offering too lellanother day goes by he gets his pieces and he posts pictures so here's a picture of his child reaching for those ppajonpezesanybody know what those ten thousand bitcoins were worthin back then chicagoanybody wantto stay back then
forty-one dollarlast i was saying two pieces whore probably worth twenty-five to thirty because there's a whole email threat ekept saying why won't anybody get me my pieces you can make money on thisearlesixt-six million ollarmaytwenty-second every year is called pcoiso whatis block chane technology these are my words but there sort of piced from the literature and so forthit verifiably moves data on a d-centralized network and the economics block chain tech
nreally verification in economic severifiationand economics f netwrkingand in many ways block chain adds a certain costs to the verification through this consensus protocol it will be studyingbut it lowers some other cost of verifiation because you're not relying on a centralized authority so its really a tradeoff of cost of verifioi don't think ot pur better or worse but i's a trade-off of cost of verificn through decentralized networksthe data can be value like bitcoin with a money system hor the data can be act
computer codeand will learn lot about smart contracts and data being verified computer code in algorithmsmy world finance this directly goes to the plumming of finance because finance is fundamentally about moving money and rist through a network and that network is the seven-million people that live otwork it's moving money and risk yuvoutken finance courses or many of you have it's the intermediation of money andrest throughout our economybut there's a whole hosto challengesnd
the course of the semester will talk about this challenges technical commercial and public policy hurdleswill they be solved wl they not be slvedbut it could be a catlytbut we're not sure yetfor change in the world of money and financeso aanybody wantto tell me the role of money in societytell me your first exchange between meedium of exchange gmediumof exchange sobo give me a second
ellow shirt savings so that would be a store of valuei'm sorry gentlemen hereunitive accountiaso wern to spend some time next tusday talking more about money and the role of money in the history of money which i think its suitaflays a foundational piece of iwhat about the role of finance i've alredyset a few things abouttsorry i dont know your worole of finance
tell any finaialfinance professor wht your answerto raise meygn anybody connects svrs and barso connecting is sort of moving money mvsoat's tpiece of itmoving-making valuations use the words moving allocating and pricing pricing is the valuaionof moneybutlet's not forget it also about risk when you buy insurance that's a transference of risk when you buy an
quity stock that's a transferrence of risk if you enter into a complex credit to pougtswap that's a transferrence of risk so finances not just the movement of money it's the movement of riskaswellthroughthe economyand i always think finance i alway thought this wheni was a govmensacks for eighteen years that finance sits at the neck of an hourglass and it's why it collects so much economic rents from society as when you sit at the neck of an hourglass and billions literally trillions of grains a sand go by if you collect some of those grains asn
uberwealththoe for other classes but finance can collect a lot of economic rentsthe financial sector though has a bunch of challenges will have one lecture later in the semester about some of those challenges and a reading i think shila bear wrote something recently that ist you ought to read later in te semestor but we will talk about the financial crisis and some othe problems but its atalota crises feot currencies have a lot of instabilities of course we have centralized intermediaries layd oun and will talk about collect a lot of economic rentsso there's there's opportunity block chain has real opportunity to cuna
munder this world of finance and may bdo some things bettercentral banking also have a bunch of legacy payment systems in those legacy payment systems are slowly adapting but it's slowand why did allipay do so well in china is part of the story because there are so ma unbanked just like ampasa in kenya but here in the us we still pay two and-ahalf to three percent for our interchange charges for visamtergarean allot of clearing and settlement still has a lot of counterparty risk  icareto lieve out financial inclusion there's still one point seven billion people in this world who are unbanked
think of it a much in developed countries but it's certainly true imany products even here in the usand these are to  the opportunities finances seven-and-a-half percent of us economy that's one and a-half trillion dollars a revenuessany ofyouthink about entveneure opportunitiesthe payment system just here in the us is a half-o percent to one percent of our economy that's one hundred to two hundred billion dollars a reveuesvsis about eighteen iyou know when you add up the whole payment system that's a hundred to two hundred million dollars revenuesso hat's kind of the opportunity can block chaine technology come in
it's got problems its slow its its performance issues still but cancompete with thathere some of the problems thath financial sector would say with block these real-live things that worgto study later in e semesteritdoesn't have the performance scaleabilitya modern payment system you need to be o to move about a hundred thousand payments sconda modern securities clearing the depository trust corporation the securities and exchange commission says you do about thirty thousand transactions a second but we need you to scale and your computers and everything have to be razilian to a hundred thousand transactions asecondbitcoin you can do about seven
nsactions a secondthese currently depends on the second does anywhere from twenty to seventy thousand a secondjst a sense of scalability and performance we might get there it might be three to seven years away optimistic but theyre still a bunch of performance and scalability issues privacy and security block chains by their nature or publicso theyre not fully sensorshp-resistant but there's a lot of innovation about making them more private but than that makes the public sector a little nervousinteroperability they don't necessarily work yet with other legacy systems or e
ach otherthe internet one of th great innovations of the intervet it became interoperablelthese different websites could cuma speak with each othergovernance is a very big issuall talk about nthings about governances it's hard to update the softwear of a block jaybecause if you create a decentralize where no ones in control noone can collect economic rents you  don't have sot of somebody with the ability to necessarily update software and wi'll talk later about how bidcoin updates its software and what bidcoin cor developers or and sofortbut facebook you do now
hing though they there accompany that collects a lot of profits and economic rents offor their two billion members they know how to update their softwareits a governance issue that's a real-challengethat's why the financial sectorses i'm not sure hworks thi is ready tthu what are the commercial usecases and what are the public policy issuesso right now the financial sector favors permission-block chansversus permissionless thi is gointtfour weeks from ow will come o go through these two differences butwhen it is framed  briefly permission blockchain
aknown group of people who actually participatethe half-ofyou that seduvound bitcoin you know it to be something where anybody can update the ledger permission block chainyou can't do tainescence you pick the three or twentythe australian stock exchange is updating their clearing and settling they announce they're doing a block-chain project they're doing it with digital asset and they're using hyperledger blockchain which is an ibm a software open source software but the ustralian stock exchange is gonaputed on three computers which is called three notes that they control all-three ofthem

relative to capital markets todaythere's a bunch of public policy issues will have a lecturer i'm a former regulator irond the commodity future straiding commission sobut this course is not about regulation though we have to always come back to regulation we always have to infuse what we're doing with theregulatobut let me just give you little framework and then you'llhave to be bord  a handful of weeks and igave some congressional testimony onyes it will be required reading bits garding against elicit activitya lot of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies started out in the cpunk
ort of movement and libertarian movement sand is true you can use this for elicit activity absolutely but i would say crime is not knew just the mechanisms means or ocriminals yes will use this and have used it for elicit activity financial stability central bankers around the glob sort of will shake finance wll it's only two-billonthe financial markets or three-hundred ian plus not yet is generally what they're saying but for some countries it's a way to get around capital controlsandso for those countries wordabout capital controlit's v real and live set of issues
en protecting the investing pblicwhen we do this in a few weeks i'll go through each of thee investor protection issues andhowwestlike for those whowish to do theur own initial coin offering i'll vbroad sense of whattcs accomplishbutis a moving target very interesting as opposed to many of your slone classes or your c-cell classes or media lab classes this is a very unsettled area of public policyso mk it interestingif youllgo off and form companies you will actually be helping sort of set
te edge of that public policy atei'd always saiy just remember poet riley the ducktest a poet indianapoet or those that arent from us might not know the ducktest but basically if itquacks like a duck and walks like a ducket'sa duck so when everything about public policy fs like myself who once was a regulator we think in the duck testandnwe secondarily think about actual words in the congressional actwhere's the common sense of it quacks and walks like a duck it's probably a securityprobably this or thatthe incumbents like this linuss in the cornerth

usiness set of risk about regulatory risknot always i'm not like crying for jp morgan big incumbents o they have their advantagescoinbases being an incumbent rather than just startup in a senseand whille talk doing the semester about some of the incumbents wherewere probabblygong to get jeffspreckers here and mid-novemories gonno talk to about intercontonental exchange in thenew york stock exchanges doing with starbox and microsoften likethe financial sector usecases ime notconta go through these but this is the second half of the course is goinna go through each of these and will do one into-two sessions on each payment system central
ack digital currency secondary market trating the venture capital and initial coin offering space will do coonand move throughso what are we gontdo on this whole course asically argol is to learn the fundamentals that's aot roughly the first half of the course to two sessions oneconomics were gonna be talking bout theeconomics throughout the whole course but i anno reallygoust focus drill-down on t economics discussions and then riff through the financial space for nthat's our journey togetherto me it's for anybody who wants to gain critic
al-reasoning skilles thiis not just kind ofgonno change the world and revolutionize every classso i basically think of anult defense department term called ground truthsit's when the general doesn't really know wit's going on but needs to figure it out and needs to talk to that you know that corporal on the ground who h's got dirt has been shot up and says here's the real gond truth notry to talk about ground truth classseparate the muro assertion from hype and some of your readings will be some real biqui and blockch minimalist

i really didn't know ry wasnbuti wanted to give you a framework for how youre faculty-member thinks and will be on this journey togetherrange of perspectives we're nocking a be a bitcoin minimalist or maximalist i'm probably to be self-disclosed here a little bit centrminimalist on bidcoinsmart contract minimalist maxamist i'm probably pretty centrlarry's probably little centermaximalist i'm guessingyou're stil

workin to talk a lot in this course about critical thinking about when do you really need the advantage of a de-centralized purto-peer system where the costs of trust or suchthat's the right way to gobut im ne who thinks thatere was also so much economic rents in the financial system one and-a-half illion dollars of revenues or seven-anty-half percent of oeconomy or just two-hundred billion payment systems for instance that there may be times that you don't really need a de-centralized system but it just might be your opportunity to talk in underneath all of those economic rents and all those revenuesincumbents will react
incumbent commerciallyimeanand theyre gotta reactand that's why i think blockchain may well be a catalyst for change even if incumbents ten adopt ithe requirements of the ourse class participation is a hard thing to judge as a faculty member  many peolei always think class participation matterweve made it thirty perifyouveany adicethirty percent two-individual wride-ups on-in the first half which is up to i think lecture nwhich is basically the blockchainge fundamental
you pick atoic i don't care which ine but you'll tyou'll get a much better grade if it's about critical reasoning if it's really taking whatever those sets of writings are  repeating that which is in the readings butreally going henext step and saying here's what's going onthiis a business scol convince me that you know something about computer science it's a critical reasoning about the economic opportunities stren the weaknesses the opportunitis to threats that ald business school with regard to that weeks whether it's about hash functions early

that's indoce act on or fundamentalsi won't go through each ofthpieces binsyllabus of course a actois the pivot of the economics an actryar financial sector usecasesand hopefully throughwill have a lot of funsstudy questions for next tusday realquickwhat are the roles and characters with money so i really want a sort of dig behind moneymoney is but a social construct or social conventionmedium of exchange astoreo value unit of u
there'se some readings about the debate whether money first came from the borter system ora really good set of anthropologist anarchaeologist  everyin say oit actually came as a ledger systemand no one knows for short ten and fifteen thousand years ago whether money came from tohe border system or more as a unit of account keeping account of credits and ledgerbut i' say when you read through some of those readings you start to think well this is just a societal constructlbehind currency currency which is an invention really only ofthe last few hundred years wetake forgranted down but how does that fit into that whole
tory and importantly had a ledgers accounting ledgers uni boring stuff but it's probably why we came out of dark ages about five or six hundred years ago with double-entry bookkeeping i like ledgersw'll talk a little bit about ledgers and how that fits into money and-securities and so rand thenlayering-in how bitcoin fits on top of that history next tusday is not deeply about bitcoin just little opthough five or six readings one of them three-minute video the third oneit's funwthit jst a funny little
videowhat money is there's no need to read nocmoto's full paper when i said email i mean just the cover emailone paragraphmy goal in the readings each week win each session wasbianlordto try to keep less than fifty pages you say youe gonlook sometimes itlooks like it's more and maybe it isi figure you're aonta figure out for yourself  sourt through the depth of your knowledge but i will predict that some of you maybe as much as a quarter or third of your gonna go down a rapit holl one dayand you're gont bdoing block chain for the next forty-eight hours and you wont know where the time went because i an addiction at some point that someof you will
causerous notioni'm not predicting thatinfirmity for all of yousome of you will happened so occasionally readings levits conclude and then take any other questions and maide up their block chain i think does provide a pearedpeer alternative i think tlaralbeotiits it does proand thatpeer-to-pear alternative addresses cost of trust it doesn't mean its the only way to address cost to trust but itddresses cost otrustthe financial sector does have challengesjt that it has seven andahalf percent of our economy in
