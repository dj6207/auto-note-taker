cause we're goig to have a good time this smester my name is garry gensler i'm a senior lecturer here at m i t sloane i'm also an adviser over at the m i t medialab and i've spent a lifetime around the world of finance and money and public policy and i've been at m i t this last eight months and we're going to learn a lot together about block chain and money we're goin to have a little bit of fun here and see what we'reging to do so we're talking about block chain and money that's where we are ah by the way a i do calld call i do call on you if you want to leave now i understand  because i want to have an interaction
a little bit about it so my first question for the class for everyone whether registered or not how many of you have ever owned a crypto currency wait wait let's see the odds it seems like is about forty five per cent of youor so s kis me theline you want to keep your hand up long  and how many of you have ever worked on any block chain related projects in an aunch benurial setting or corporate setting anywhere right good o about a third in the room good all right so you all know probably more than i do
but i'm going to give it a shot ah im wo to always start every week with what are the study questions for the week a how many of you actually got the syllabus is is not going to be grated to simon i just have to have a sense whos who actually got the syllabus so a good many of you and how many of you actually did the two readings it's not graded i just got ogauge the class oh thank you thank you write those grades down by the w no all right so the two main questions for this week's lecture really is what is block chain and why might it be a catalyst and i emphasize the word might it be a catalyst for change in the world of finance we could talk about a lot about things outside of the world of finance and block chain may indeed have a lot
applications outside of finance but i've chosen to try to just narrow the scope a bit so this semesteris really about block chain and money or block chain and finance and secondly you will see index cards on every one of these round tables one assignment by the end of the class you could do it now or later i would like each of you to anonymously write on the card what you want to achieve in this semester it cond be anything from this class from learning about block chain from making money on bit coinor i don't care if you tell me it's meeting your future spouse i just like what do you want to achieve in this class i can't help you on the third
but i will try to help you and the things i can help you i and sabrina and toledo will collect em later and next tuesday we'll tell you the results what is it that you want to achieve in this class and then we'll see at the end of the samester if we've done that so that's just a way to help guide me help you so that's that's what we're trying to do and so what were the two readings one was a little thing i did and one was the thing i did with some of my colleagues and ah tom since i know you what do you take out of the readingsl do ro ruffte el
did you have a good summer did you raise your hand tid you on bitqont ah who in the class read the readings and took something different than tom he said there was potential and your first name sunny lin well i'm coming from technical sit i technical sital i see as a bunch of tipe and ten yearsamat in re soi how many agreed with lon this isn't a vote her just two or three how many agreed with tom ss more and how many of you 're too shy on the first day to put your hands up
ah so i'm going to start and go back the inner net how do i sort of i've come about this and sort of thought about well what is block chain what is it really about well the inner net started many decades ago before most of you were born but nineteen seventy four sh i mean theye're some predecessors even from the late sixties the ether net which is really how two computers communicate and then you had t c p i p which wers really the inner net protocol of multiple computers compute talking to each other a and then later on in nineteen ninety how do we move forward does anybody know what h t t p is word am i t
your first name would be helperiar it's a proteb foro omek e whip conten web content yperex ad transpor o you know who who's associated with the invention ani don't remember anybody else anybody know who it's not in the reading ny tims burnard lee ah anybody know who's associated with t c p i pi whois e company initiated by mit at  baronya i don't know if it was accompany associate withmy te
buta a vinser may have had some association with him myte ah so these are first three letters and then there were companies commercialization three com in cisco and of course amazon that's still around to day but there was something else going on how do we commercialize the internut does anybody know what this scene is from tis is upost tobe soi a good thought good thought first petes is sove by bitqo but no movie hackers it movie hackersnet the net do you now have you ever seen the movie it's not a good move
so this is the opening scene of the net and yes that's sander bullock and the year's nineteen ninety five it's a sibr thriller  you know a president's involved the defense departments involved and so forth but actually petshut is associated with the very first sale on line sale anywhere in the world they started something called pets an nut this was the screen by the way if you wanted to go on you could order your petsa  and anda but there was one problem does anybody know what the problem was was pets annet maybe there were monsible problems no aline i've calht on you
al you couldn't pay on line nobodyd figured out how to move money on line you had to pay when you showed up with the piza so now i'm going to talk a little bit about cryptography we're going to spend a lot of time on cryptography it's is crypto currenciesand and the like whats your nam g g g he g he what's cryptographybemit  cryptic all right  you got it you got a start there anybody want to help g out does aneybody want to help yoot tell me your first name we're going to ask we're going to figure out how to have everybody have name plates by next week but we'll work with
anddo it that way but ae idea it's the icnology of the sins behind  inscription indicition  modification o how do you incrip the particular nex that it's not readable by someonees without having te so it's how do you incript something so it's not detectable by others or in essence it's communications in the presence of adversaries you have an adversary who wants the communication you want to communicate and not let your adversaries know that communication and this is this is true for ancient times so in ancient times there was something called the cipher and this was the way that you take a piece of leather or a piece of
ot and have a lot of letters and both sides youd incript and decripped because there were different measurements of the cylinder has anybody seen the the movie imitation gamesright the enigma machine now the movie was wonderful cause it said toring cracked it and he did help crack it in an automatic way but actually the polish government had cracked it in the nineteen thirties before they fell to the germans but and and turing built on all that and cracked it further and then in the nineteen seventies and this was here at m i t to some extent there'spr
key public k cryptography which i'm not going to dive into to day but its it's the heart of bitcoin and block chain it's at the heart of the inner net ah but it's about the key thing is communications in the presence of adversaries had e keep a secret when everybody wants in and get that information and there's a long history and m iteas it the center of a lot of that a lot of early cryptography failed on the inter net in the early nineties and late eighties david cham and others v tried to do things and we're not going to debate these to day but you'll have one reading i think it's either next week ah which will give you that history
it's worth while knowing about the history of failure but cryptography is the reason why the internet works to day does anybody want to tell me what s s l and t t l s is we have any computer scientists remind me your first name er thats  padicle that mounts on sop lik a t c t  p facto provide o friction using a symmetric case which is putlii rept cryptography that secures up e laer entrat so it basically uses a symmetric cryptography which we're going to talk about two lectures from now but it secures the whole internet
all of a sudden you could deliver the piza and get a pias code and i have to tell you i never knew how this worked before i was at m i t o paypal came along in nineteen ninety eight i mention thas a whole bunch of other digital currencies then failed but some of these people who will read later like will read nick sabo's a piece on smart contracts later adam back who created hash cash some of these innovations were what setochi noc moto later used some innovations which were really helpful and worked were ali pe and m pesa does anybody know what
pases it's using kenya as like mobile cellular and able cash riigt in essence they found out in kanya this was ten twelve years ago that people were trading mobile minutes they were unbanked but they had cellular phones and they were trading their minutes as a form of currency and sapori com realized that and said we we can help people be part of the digital economy even if they're unbanked and in africa to day a half of the adult population according to world bank figures is still unbanked but half of that half has mobile
m p says twenty million customers in ceno rite now so it's it's a form of money that's kind of swapping mobile minutes but the riddle remained how do you move money on the inter net or in essence how do you move value peer oppeer without a centralized intermediary and that's the core of block chain technology so who solved the riddle is anybody to tell me who solved the riddle who solved this riddlemute you're you're wearing a tea shirt that says quenton terrentino so i think quentn terentino should solve a riddle
what's that what your namees and who solved this riddle so a pear to pure cash this is the actual dock top of a nemale that was sent out on holloween two thousand and eight by sitoci nacomoto we don't actually know who stochi nocomoto is but it's a study question of a few lectures fromo to ask you to tell me who you think satochi nocomoto is so i won't ask that now and he started with a very simple sentence in his email i've been working on a new electronic cash system that fully peered to peer with no trusted third party
it's kind of a modest statement and so the question is is this another inornet layer we're going to explore that this wholesome ester i don't i don't really have the answer i don't think the best minds in m i t could really yet tell you there are some who are maximlist and say yes it will be and there are others who will say no no no and in this course we're going we're going to review the minimalist and the maximlis we're not we're not going to try to centre it in one place but that's the kk kind of question so what is a block chain we're going to do this in a lot of lectures but i'm going to try to do it in a short version
so it's time stamped append logs meaning you can add a little bit of information to this and it's time stamped so these are these blocks being added sotose did not invent block chain is way earlier does anybody want to guess when it was you're oing to have a reading about this later but early nineteen nineties stert haer what's that madors stewart be steart haber stewart haber worked for bellaps right so one of your assignments it's not going to be a graded assign winth thust going to be a fun assignment
could any of you i gon to say by next thursday just have some fun find the longest in time wise longest running block chain it's not bit coin and it's been running since the mid nineties and your clue is the new york timesand we'll discuss it next thursday but this time stamped block block block block of data creates a data base an auditable data base and we'll talk about ledgers particularly next week but we'll talk about ledgers all throughout this course and how it changes the world of finance now it's secured by
tography because cryptography remembers communications and making sure adversaries can't pick you off we're going to learn about hash functions and hach functions is a really important part of cryptography and initially for data basisand and how to search and store information and data basis but in this circumstance s hash functions were the way to not only append the next block to the prior blocks but really importantly to compress data to make it more manipulble and to verify it and as i've written here  tamper resistance and the integrity digital signatures which has to do the public key private
cryptography there is no prerequisite of this course you do not have had to have taken computer science cryptography agorithms if i could learn a little bit about hash functions and a symmetric chryptography these are the two key important sides and we have enough computer scientists in this room that can sort us out if i say the wrong thing right medors holy and then consensus so there's a really important part of block chain is how do you decide who appends that next block cause when i went back here there's block and block each of these blocks somebody has to decide who appends
who gets to pick the next block and that's what's called consensus protoco and there's wide debates about consensus protoco and we'll talk a lot about consensus protoco but in essence it addresses something a term called the cost o trust and we'll talk about byzantine generals problems which is another reading the byzantine general's problem was laid out as a sort of mathematical game theory issue some thirty years ago that's what sitoshi nacomoto solved was this last partof the byzantine general's problem petso for bid coins a year and a half after sitoshi nacomoto
laid out block chain bit coin somebody sent an emal and you'll get these slides but this is the real live emale i'll pay you ten thousand bit coins for a couple of pieces i just want some pieces the guy who sent this he says i like onions pepper sausage mushrooms laslow now catch the date this is may eighteenth and he's offering ten thousand bit coins of two thousand and ten but the key line is what i'm aiming for is getting food delivere in exchange for bit coins nobody had used bit coins as a medium of exchange sixteen months into hits exexistence nobody had used it to buy some
thing and laslow is a computer scientist in florida was just kind of interested and he put this out an emale list three days later he still doesn't have his two pieces so nobody wants to buy me o peateis the bit coin amount i'm offering too lo another day goes by he gets his pieces and he posts pictures so here's a picture of his child reaching for those papa john pieaces anybody know what those ten thousand bit coins were worth back in back then chicago they wer gohaha anybody want to save back that
what's that forty one dollars and lastly was saying two peaches are probably worth twenty five to thirty cause there's a whole emale thread he kept saying why won't anybody get me my peaches you can make money on this to day or early or late yet last night sixty six million dollars no so it's a  an acute story a may twenty second every year is called peats a day or bit coine peats a day or somethings so what is block chain technology these are my words but they're sort of picked from the literature and so forth it verifiably moves data on a decentralized network and the economics of block chain
ology are are really around that verification in the economics of verification and the economics of net working and in many ways block chain adds certain costs to the verification through this consensus protocol that will be studying but it lowers some other cost of verification because you're not relying on a centralized authority so it's really a trade off of cost of verification i don't think it's i'm not a purist that says it's better or worse but t it's a trade off of costs of verification through decentralized networks the data can be value like bit coin was a money system or the data can be
computer code and we'll learn a lot about smart contracts and you could have the dato being verified computer code and algaritms my world finance this directly goes to the plumbing of finance because finance is fundamentally about moving money and risk through a network and that network is the seven billion people that live in this word it's moving money and risk and you've all taken finance courses or many of you have and it's the intermediation of money and risk throughout our economy but there's a whole host of challenges
overthe course of this smaster we'll talk about those challenges technical commercial and public policy hurdles will they be solved will they not be solved but it could be a catalist but we're not sure yet for change in the world of money and finance so does anybody want to tell me the the roll of money in society hen tell me your first name thomas tomas isi tewe exchange fings themselves between people medium of exchange got that one witot twen bat   exchangean medium of exchange somebody give me a second a
ellow shirt medim al savi savings all right so that would be a store of value third i'm sorry the gentleman hereus unit of account well all right there we go there we go so we're goin to spend some time next tuesday talking more about money and the roll of money and the history of money which i think is sort of lays a foundational piece of this what about the roll of finance i've alreadyoof said a few things about that butandi i'm sorry i don't know your name but i'm prettyer the woman roll of finance
i'm not going to tell any financial finance professor what your answer is to raise money so  keep going i'm going to anybody else whencan connect savers and barrers an connect savers and barrs so connecting is sort of moving money moving  orasions valuations so that's the pieces of it its sort os moving making valuations i use the words moving allicating and pricing pricing is the valuations of money but let's not forget it's also about risk when you buy insurance that's a transference of risk when you buy an
equity stock that's a transference of risk if you enter into a complex credit to fought swap that's a transference of risk so finance is not just the movement of money it's the movement of risk as well throughout the economy and i always think finance i always ve thought this when i was at golment sack for eighteen years that finance sits at the neck of an hour glass and it's why it collects so much economic rents from society as when you sit at the neck of an hour glass and billions literally trillions of grains of sand go by if you collect some of those grains of sand
you get uber wealth and that's those are for other classes but finance can collect a lot of economic rents the financial sector though has a bunch of challenges we'll have one lecture later in the semester about some of those challenges and we have a reading i think shilebert wrote something recently that i asked you all to read later in the semester but well talk about the financial crisis and some of the problems but it's had a lot of crises fiot currencies have a lot of instabilities of course we have centralized intermediaries as i lay down and we'll talk about collect a lot of economic rents so there's there's opportunity block chain has real opportunity to cuna
under this world of finance and maybe do some things better a central banking also have a bunch of legacy payment systems and those legacy payment systems are slowly adapting but it's slow and why did ally pay do so well in china is part of the story because there were so many unbanked just like mpasa in kanya but here in the u s we still pay two and a half to three per cent for our interchange charges for visa master card and and the like and a lot of clearing and settlement still has a lot of counterparty risk and one that i care deeply about financial inclusion there's still one point seven billion people in this world who are unbanked
so we don't think of it as much in developed countries but it's certainly true in  many products even here in the u s and these are to me the opportunities finance is seven and a half per cent of the u s economy that's one and a half trillion dollars o revenues so any of you thatr think about antrbenoria opportunities the payment system just here in the u s is a half a per cent to one per cent of our economy that's one hundred to two hundred billion dollars in revenues i think vis is about eighteen billion just nod but you know when you add up the whole payment system that's a hundred to two hundred billion dollars in payment revenues so that's kind of the opportunity can block chain technology come in
it's got problems it's slow it's its performance issues still but can it compete with that here are some of the problems the financial sector would say with blockand these are real live things that we're going to study later in the semester they say it doesn't have the performance scale ability a modern payment system you need to be able to move about a hundred thousand payments a second a modern securitis clearing the depositorya trust corporation the securities and exchange commission says you do about thirty thousand transactions a second but we need you to scale and your computers and everything have to be resilient to a hundred thousand transactions a second bit coin you can do about seven
actions a second viz currently depends on that the second does anywhere from twenty to seventy thousand a second so itis just a sense of scale ability and performance we might get there it might be three to seven years away i optimistic but they're still a bunch of performance and scale ability issues privacy and security block chains by their nature are public so they're not fully censorship resistant but there's a lot of innovation about making them more private but then that makes the public sector a little a nervous inner operability they don't necessarily work yet with other legacy systems or with
ah other the inner net one of the great innovations of the intervet it became interoperable that all these different web sites could kind of speak with each other governance is a very big issue we'll talk about and one of the things about governante is it's hard to up date the soft war of a block jay because if you create a decentralized where no one's in control no one can collect economic rents you also don't have a sort of somebody with the ability to necessarily up date the soft ware and we'll talk later about how bit coin up dates its soft ware and what bit coin cor developers are and so forth but face book you do kno
one thing though they're they're a company that collects a lot of profits and economic rents off their two billion members a they know how to up date their software a it's it's a governmente issue that's a real life aa challenge and that's why the financial sector says i'm not sure this works this is ready yet for me and then thus what are the commercial use cases and what are the public policy issues so right now the financial sector favors permission block chains versus permission list this is going to bebout four weeks from now will kind of go through these two differences but i wan to just frame this briefly permission block chains
a known group of people who actually participate the half of you that said you've owned bit coin you know it to be something where anybody can update the ledger permission block chains you can't do that in essence you pick the three or twenty the australian stock exchange is up dating their clearing and settling they announce thei're doing a block chain project they're doing it with the digital assets and they're using the hyper ledger block chain which is an i b m a soft ware open source soft ware but the australian stock exchange is going to put it on three computers which is called three nodes that they control all three of em
the depository trust corporation is looking at block chain inspired solutions for some of their data warehouses but they too were going to control the notes i'mjust givin that's permission block chains there's nothing wrong with that that's just how they the they're looking at this permission list block chains are like bit coin unknown participants securities based on incentives a crypto currency and crypto economics crypto finance is about two hundred billion but you know you have to update these slides daily two days ago it was two hundred thirty billion a and this little pie chart is a little over half is bit coin the next slice is something called
rium and then ripple down the line we're not going to spend a lot of time in this this simesteri if your goal is to how can you profit and trade day trade bit coin and day trade ether god bless go prosper you can stay in the class i just won't give you much advice on it this is not a crypto investing centred class but i'm ok if that's what you're doing does anybody know what the world wide capital market size is evybody want to guess no this is two hundred billion what's it look like i've already said it's modest hundreds of drillions global equity about eight
trillion global bond in debt markets two hundred fifty trillion so it's still quite modest compared to that broad breadth of of capital formation and gold if bitcoin's digital gold what's the value of gold all the gold that's ever been tom i seven trillon seven trillion they'll just give you cents a scale so there's also something that's interesting about this space is that it's outside public attention even as evidenced by the hundred of you in this room versus the size
is re relative to the capital markets to day there's a bunch of public policy issues we'll have a lecture i'm a former regulator i ran the commodity fegistrating commission so but this course is not about regulation though we have to always come back to regulation we always have to infuse what we're doing with the regulation but let me just give you a little framework and then you'll have to be bored in a handful of weeks and read i gave some congressional testimony on it yes it will be required reading sorry a but it's guarding against illicit activity a lot of bit coin and crypto currencies started in the sib punk
sort of movement and an libertarian movement so forth and it is true you can use this for illicit activity absolutely but i would say crime is not new just the mechanisms and means are new and and so the criminals yes will use this and have used it for illicit activity financial stability central bankers around the globe sort of will this shake finance well it's only two hundred billion the financial markets are three hundred trillion plus not yet is generally what they're saying but for some countries it's a way to get around capital controls and so for those countries worried about capital controls it's a very real and live set of issues
and then protecting the investing public and when we do this in a few weeks i'll go through each of these the investor protection issues and yes the  c c howwe testa and and the like for those who wish to do their own initial coin offering i'll give some inaw broad sense of what the c c is trying to accomplish but it's a moving target sois it so very interesting as opposed to many of your sloan classes or your seasal classes or media lab classes this is a very unsettled area of public policy so it makes it interesting if you all go off and form companies youwill actually be helping sort of set the
the edge of that public policy to debate i'd always say just remember poet riley the duck test hit's a poet indiana poet or those that aren't from the u s might not know the duck test but basically if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck it's a duck so whenever you're thinking about public policy folks like myself who once was a regulator we think in the duck test and then we secondarily think about the actual words in the congressional act you know where's the common sense and if it quacks and walks like a duck it's probably a security or it's probably this or that the incumbents like this lionis in the corner
eyeing this space because there's a lot of volatility and wall street makes money on volatility volatility is the friend of wall street it might not be the friend of investors but it's a friend of wall street they also like the trading volumes and the spreads coin base the largest a crypto exchange here in the u s his twenty million accounts they might not all be active but that's the size of fidelity's membership or account list and twice desa and robin hood how many of you have ever used robin hood is a trading up well half of you so you know free trading right five million members for those who don't know you can down load robin hood and you can trade stock
for freight no commission if anybody's interested show up in outdue office hours when how robin hood commercializes they commercialize your your order flow and they make money without charging your commissions but it's a sort of wonderful a millennials love it five million members already so you'd better believe d e shaw and the incumbents are worried about things like that the start ups are also more willing to beg for forgiveness from regulators they're willing to sort of take risks and beg for forgiveness whereas incumbents tend to have to ask for permission so there's an unlevel field that always it's a symmetric aa
siness set of risk about regulatory risk not always i'm not like crying for j p morgan a i mean the big incumbents also they have their advantages and coin base is becoming an incumbent rather than just you know start up in a sense and we'll talk during the samester about some of the  incumbents where we're probably going to get jeff spreckers here in mid november he's going to talk to you about what intercontinental exchange and the new york stock exchange is doing with star books and micro soft and the like the financial sector use cases i'm not going to go through these but this is the second half of the course is going to go through each of these and we'll do one to two sessions on each payment system central
actigital currency a secondary market trading a the venture capital and initial coin offering space will do to a course on that and move through so what are we going to do on this whole course basically our goal is to learn the fundamentals that's about roughly the first half of the course pivot to two sessions on the economics we're going to be talking about the economics throughout the whole course but i want i want to really just focus drilldown on the economics on two of the discussions and then rift through financial space for the second half that's our journey together to me it's for anybody who wants to gain critic
reasoning skills this is not just kind of a hey this is going to change the world and revolutionize everything class a and so i basically think of an old defense department term called ground truths it's when the general doesn't really know what's going on but needs to figure it out and needs to talk to that you know that that corporal on the ground who's got dirt you know all overand ands been shut up and says here's the real ground truth  going to try to talk about ground truths andh ind in this class and separate the mere assertion from the hipe and some of your readings will be some real bitcoin and block chain minimals
from norio rubine that uses words i'm not supposed to repeat on a recording about this stuff to paul crugman who and joe stiglets and other nobe laureates who say no it's not going to work or warm buffet to to maximus we're we're going to try to cover both sides larry lessek is honoring me because he's in the back of the class who's enormously esteemed a professor from harvard i didn't know larry was going to be here and i did the slide before but in nineteen ninety nine i think you wrote this book larry is that right a code and other laws of cyrus face i put you on but i think it's worth while to think about
larry's four bits hereand i don't know larry if you want to say anything but i'm going to try to infuse this course and just how do you think about this the tec wered am i t the technology and we're going to get you a lot of technology if you want more than i can give you is is is a former finance sort of type my whole life there's going to be a bunch of computer science people in the class we're going to hook you up together with the folks from the mediolab and cesal and and tro to connect you to the technology side if you want to swim deeper in that pond but the technology really really matters and that's why we are going to go through hash functions and
through a symmetric cryptography and so forth from a business perspective markets matter why is it that incumbents or start ups are or not doing this and that why is it ten years in and nobody's got an enterprise wide solution yet to payments that use block jain the law matters the public policy side matters and the fourth of larry's lay out social norms that's a little harder for me to teach that's not what this class is about but it also effects all this it's not just the technology the markets and the law so it's not just a three legged stool it's kind of a four legged stool how do i do larry i
i really didn't know harry was going to be here a but i wanted to give you a framework for how your faculty member thinks and we'll be on this journey together range of perspectives we're not going to be a bitcoin minimalist or maximalist i'm probably to be self disclosed here a little bit centerminimalist on bit coin smart contract minimalist maximist i'm probably pretty center larry's probably a little bit center maximalist i'm guessing i hoping i can be be youn teach me we ose you're
you're still center r center minimalist what smart contracts ah and then block chain maximalist or minimalist i'd say a few weeks ago i was kind of center maxim list and i'm sort of skidding back to the middle a a permission block chain i a little bit more and there's some in here alone is one of your sloan cohort that you might know six months ago when we met was working on a permission list system and now you're working on a permission system you have a storet up jus like you you bounce up into the market realities as and
we're going to talk a lot in this course about critical thinking about when do you really need the advantage of a decentralized piertepeer system where the costs of trust are such that that's the right way to go but i am one who thinks that there's also so much economic rents in the financial system that that one and a half trillion dollars of revenues or seven and a half per cent of our economy or just two hundred billion in the payment systems for instance that there may be times that you don't really need a decentralized system but it just might be your opportunity to tuck in underneath all those economic rents and all those revenues now incumbents will react
you poke an incumbent commercially poke em i mean and they're going to react and that's why i think block chain may well be a catalist for change even if incumbents then adopt a lot of that inside ah the requirements of the courus class participation is a hard thing to judge as a faculty member when i have this many people but i always think class participation matters  we've made it thirty per cent which a if you have any advice this next invester a thirty per cent two two individual rit ups one in the first half which is up to i think lecture ten which is basically the block chain fundamental
you pick a topic i don't care which one but it's you'll get you'll get a much better grade if it's about critical reasoning if it's really taking whatever those sets of writings are and and and and and not just repeating that which is in the readings but really going the next step and saying here's what's going on and this is a business school you don't have to you know convince me that you know something about computer science it's like critical reasoning about the economic opportunities the strength the weaknesses the opportunities the threats that old business school sio saying of swats a with regard to that week's whether it's about hash functions or
on cryptography or you sort of wait during the foundational period to permission versus permission less you pick but to please hand it in before that classs lecture cause i might during the lecture say who wrote to day do you want to tell us what you think and it might help spur the class participation and then a second right up in the second half when we're riffing through the ah use cases again critical reasoning and then lastly a the usual approach of teams of up to four no i don't want teams of five handle that right noww three or four just an in in to somewhere in the second half
semester well talk about more of the content and there's a couple of you in here that worked with me last somester in a smaller group ah you know i want you to do well so i'm going to sort of give you a senseof like what we want to do but it's basically the idea is you're an ochbanor or you're an incumbent and what sort of use case ar you in a pickdd and whether it's permissioned or permission less sort of make a proposal do a use case use your critical reasoning around this new technology somewhere in the broad world of finance i mean you know  i'm glad define finance really broad you know you'll pick so that
that's kind of the piece act one are the fundamentals i won't go through each of the pieces but you know that's in the syllabus of course act two is the pivot of the economics and act three our financial sector use cases and a hopefully throughout w we'll have a lot of fun so the study questions for next tuesday a real quick what are the roles and characteristics of money so i really want a sort of dig behind money money is but a social construct or a social convention medium of exchange a store of value unit of account
there'se some readings about the debate whether money first came from the barter system or a really good set of anthropologists an archaeologist and everything say no it actually came as a ledger system and no one knows for sure ten and fifteen thousand years ago whether money came from the out of the barter system or more as a unit of account keeping account of credits and ledger but i'd say when you read through some of those readings you start to think well this is just a society construct nso that well get behind that what is fiot currency fiot currency which is an invention really only f the last few hundred years we take for granted now but how does that fit into that whole
tory and importantly had a ledgers accounting ledgers i know boring stuff but it's probably why we came out of the dark ages about five or six hundred years ago with double entry bookkeeping ah sorry i like ledgers ah we'll talk a little bit about ledgers and how that fits into money and securities and so forth and then layering in how bit coin fits on top of that history next tuesday is not deeply about bit coin it's just a little dollop on that there'll be five or six readings one of em's a three minute video the third one it's fun watch it it's just a funny little
vidio on what money is there's no need to read noc motos full paper when i said the emal i mean just the cover emal it's one paragraph my goal in the readings each week was not on each session was byin lord to try to keep less than fifty pages youd say you're going to look sometimes ago it looks like it's more and maybe it is i figure you're all going to figure out for yourself how to sor through the depth of your knowledge but i will predict that some of you maybe as much as a quarter or a third of you are going to go down a rabbit hole one day and you're going to be doing block chain for the next forty eight hours and you won't know where the time went because it is an addiction at some point that some of you
get ecause it's a curious notion i'm not predicting that infirmity for all of you im mis saying some of you will have that happen to you so occasionally i've readings just why lan it's haven to you i think a let me just conclude and then take any other questions and lat up there block chain i think does provide a peer to peer alternative i think that i i hope larry i'll be able to convince it does provide and that peer to pear alternative address is cost of trust it doesn't mean it's the only way to address cost of trust but addresses cost o trust the financial sector does have challenges not just that it has seven and a half per cent of our economy in
u s and similar ratios around the globe ah but resilience how it survives shocks the financial crisis and things like that ae are real and inclusion one point seven billion people unbanked but then if you look at other products who has access to credit cards and mortgages and the like and then fiot currencies canrogoff and others have written a lot about the instabilities that come that fiot currencies and we'll talk about some of the history and why central banks exist and how  came about a next key point is we already live in an electronic age stoci nacomoto and bitcoin didn't create electronic
cash electronic cash i mean sandra bullock couldn't pay electronically that was nineteen ninety five they did a sort of be rated movie about it all but by to day you pay your tuition one line those of you who work get paid one line you pay your auto loans on line most of our lives are electronic cash not a hundred per cent but in some countries like sweden it's getting very close to a hundred per cent ah we'll learn together and discover that money's but a social and economic consensus
block chain technology along to crypto phinance might be a catalyst for change and thet much masquerades is fact but it's only mere assertion we're going to try to sor through that those differences that doesn't mean that all of you are going to walk out agreeing with paul crugman ad nobel loriad or norio rubini that this is just a bunch of nonsense some of you might by the way but but i think you'll come out with real critical thinking skalls and i hope that some of you will say i've figured out actually where there's a real opportunity in the world of finance to use block chain technology and make it a
better financial sasector democratizing finance or somehow providing a service at a lower cost a better service throughout i hope throughout that we'll learn together and we'll have a bit of fun along the way that's kind of my thoughts questions we have exactly eighteen minutes leego but we can cut it short too i don't care there we go cas you tell me your name and we're going to do placards ryan's going to work to figure out  oand do placards cause it's young years i wonder how are the teams formed parent pojest how the teams formed
traditionally anybody at slownd can can speak to this too but students do it their own so that the faculty doesn't sort of try to insert themselves to help you but we we tend towards the latter half a say well who's formed up in groups and when you know if it's a smaller group it's like well anybodyis not yet formed in a team why don't you move to the left anid of the room and just get together but we could do that electronically too and you know whether tolida and sabrina who younow could help in turn basically have a social network to help form the teams cause this is a big group you're right but that's traditionally people whos students do it on their own otherqe
is anybody going to go out and sell their bit coin nownolarry what what wire you here no no let ia the payment er no i'm here because i think you're gon to ring with a critical scepticism so the whole feel ais you're incredibly informed about the finance side so i want to see the combination of the husand mother at the end i'm still convinced there's ateree i am convinceed there's i to there as we've spoken because i oty think it co radically changed the cost of trust aroun the world and thate will benefit developing nations
u  us a lot of questions as toho  i thank you for coming and any week you can be here any day we benefit and i hope it's really this is meant to be a conversation i'm not that far ahead of you simon johnson approached me last october and said what do you think about coming up to have my tea and and tom knows this story and we were sitting down for lunch an d c and it was a good time in my life my three girls i've three daughters and i'm a single dad and they were a twor in grad school and one ore underground it was a good time in my life i said why not younow come up here and get engaged in this digital currency initiative over at the medi lab
and i've spent a life i was eighteen years at gomansacks on the investment banking side helping people buy and sell companies called murgers and acquisitions and then i went to the trading side fixed income and went off to asia and did a bunch i ran the fixed income ind currency and swap trading in asia and then my last job was the co finance officer so we were about a quarter of a trillion dollar balance sheet at that time  gomansacks this is we were still private which meant if we lost money we were personally i was a general partner was coput that's a technical word and a a but we had we had seven hundred legal entities and one thousand people who could commit
the capital of the firm those are people we generally call traders but you know it was a fascinating pere at o time i then went on to a public service because bob reuben knew that i'd be a soft touch to service he was the treasury secretary i was te former partner at goldman sack's and i went off to the u s treasury as a assistant secretary and under secretary in the late nineties a little different times than we have now for many reasons a but we were paying down the debt we were dealing with the age and debt crisis long term capital management the russian debt crisis is is sort of a fascinating period of time i worked on a bill with john mc kane i didn't get to know senator mc kan
that well but it as just remarkable to work with even for a short period time called e signature it was a bill that basically said you can sign everything electronically and he was the chair of the senate commerce committee at the time is wonderful sometimes in government you can work on small things i worked on the re design of the currency and i can tell you stories about why it looks the way it does and how you can re design paper currency and for a future lecture i'll tell you the one designed feature that i is still in the currency and you can visually see it cause and when i asked for it the fellow that ran the burea of engraving said why and i said cause it looks better and i'm the guy that's approving itd maybe can we get it done can we work
and it did look better and he loved it he was worried about the political risk of doing it it was a better design he just i said i'll cover you politically let's do it ah but then i worked with paw sorbans an what became sorbans oxley i was his senior adviser i worked and kicked around some political campaigns we lost two of em that would be the o eight hilary campaign and the sixteen hilary campaign i was her chief financial officer i was in o at a senior adviser doing economic policy and outreach and handholding and ah gosh a and a a and then in the middle of those two campaigns i ran something called the commodity futures trading commission which was post
sis what'll we do this is a real public policy a shortcoming and and i looked at it as an opportunitty to as i said democratize finance a bit and lower risk and so we tried to bring transparency to a three or four hundred trillion dollar market called swaps which you're just contracts for transference of risk and and ta form of derivative thatt we're unregulated and we were trying to bring transparency to that and lower risk through central clearing a so that sort of my professional life and as i said i got three dollars and t they're well situated so when simon said come on up i said greatad i love imit it's just terrific and
and you all are are great unless there's other questions i'm going to let you go earlyyou knowi don't
